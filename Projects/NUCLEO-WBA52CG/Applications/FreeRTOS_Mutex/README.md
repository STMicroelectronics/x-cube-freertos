## <b>FreeRTOS_Mutex Application Description</b>

This application demonstrates the use of mutexes to serialize access to a shared resource.

The application has two threads:

    -Thread1 : Prints messages counting from 1 to 10 ("Thread1 : This is message number x")
               Blinks the green LED every second

    -Thread2 : Prints messages counting from 1 to 10 ("Thread2 : This is message number x")
               Blinks the blue LED every second

The mutex is created before the threads using it are scheduled. Each thread will try to acquire it
before outputting characters to the serial port. Once the mutex is acquired, the thread will proceed
to printing its message, and then immediately releases it.

If the mutex is not used, the two threads will try to use "printf" at almost the same time. This will
result in either thread winning over the other or both threads interrupting each other.

The user can observe the effect of not using a mutex to protect printf by setting the
`EXAMPLE_USES_MUTEX` define in Src/app_freertos.c to 0.

#### <b>Expected success behavior</b>

If the `EXAMPLE_USES_MUTEX` is set to 0, some messages will not be printed, or may be corrupted.

If the `EXAMPLE_USES_MUTEX` is set to 1, each thread will display 10 messages identified by the thread name
and the message number , for a total of 20 messages. Additional messages will be printed to displayed when
the mutex is acquired or released.

The blue LED and green LED will toggle every second.

#### <b>Error behaviors</b>

On failure, the red LED starts toggling while the green LED and blue LED are switched OFF.

#### <b>Assumptions if any</b>
None

#### <b>Known limitations</b>
None

### <b>Notes</b>
None

#### <b>FreeRTOS usage hints</b>
The FreeRTOS heap size configTOTAL_HEAP_SIZE defined in FreeRTOSConfig.h is set accordingly to the
OS resources memory requirements of the application with +10% margin and rounded to the upper Kbyte boundary.
